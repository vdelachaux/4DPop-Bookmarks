# 4DPop-Bookmarks

4DPop Bookmarks manages your bookmarks (and more) from your development environment.

## Installation

Place the `4DPop_Bookmarks.4dbase` folder or an alias to it:

* in the `Components` folder next to your database structure file if you want to use it only with this database.

* in the `Components` folder in 4D if you want to use it with all your databases.

If you use the `4DPop` component, the `Bookmark` tool will automatically appear in the tool palette; just click on it to display and use it.

![4DPop][toolbar]

## Use

`4DPop Bookmarks` displays a menu allowing direct access to folders related to the database or to the 4D environment. Then a list of user bookmarks (for example: a folder, a document, a web URLâ€¦). 

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
	<td><img src="Assets/database.png" width="400"></td>
	<td><img src="Assets/application.png" width="400"></td>
</table>

According to the bookmark type, selecting one of them loads the associated URL in the default browser, reveals the folder, opens the file or create a mail.

The last menu item, "Edit BookMarks List...", allow you to modify the list of bookmarks.
 
![Editor][editor]

Adding bookmarks can be done by drag and drop from the desktop to the editor (file, folder or disk), from your browser (email address and URL) or from a text box. The dragged item is analyzed and the created menu item automatically indicates its type by associating a specific icon to it.

It is possible to delete an item by selecting it and clicking the "-" button (shortcut "delete").

You can change the bookmark name or URL by double-clicking on the part you want to edit. You can also rearrange the items by dragging and dropping, or sort them by column headers.

Note: A bookmark that begins with a dash ("-") will be displayed as a separator line in the menu.
